# my-stupid-dotfiles
These are my dotfiles for hyprland and they are very nooby.
I made this repo mostly as a backup for my dotfiles if I ever reinstall 

I suck at coding and so these are barely edited defaults.  
To install just rename the old ones to something else and download and put the folders in your ~/.config folder. 

You will need to install hyprland, waybar, nwg-dock-hyprland, kitty and nwg-drawer.
