These are my dotfiles for hyprland and they are very nooby.
I made this repo mostly as a backup for my dotfiles if I ever reinstall



I suck at coding and so these are barely edited defaults.  
To install just rename the old ones to something else and download and put the folders in your ~/.config folder. 

You will need to install hyprland, hyprpanel, kitty and nwg-drawer.

nwg-dock-hyprland and waybar are depreaceated, but I will leave the configs here if you want them.
