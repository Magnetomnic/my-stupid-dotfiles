These are my dotfiles for hyprland and they are very nooby.
I made this repo mostly as a backup for my dotfiles if I ever reinstall



I suck at coding and so these are barely edited defaults.  
To install just rename the old ones to something else and download and put the folders in your ~/.config folder, or just use the install script but make sure you have yay. Note that the script was made for arch linux and other derivative distros.

You will need to install hyprland, waybar, kitty and nwg-drawer.

I no longer use nwg-dock-hyprland so it is optional, but I will leave the style.css here if you want it.
